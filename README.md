# Dash app for forest cover in Western Area of Sierra Leone

## Running the app locally
We suggest you to create a separate virtual environment running Python 3 for this app, and install all of the required dependencies there. Run in Terminal/Command Prompt:

Assuming a python>=3.5 environment

```
cd dashboard/
python3 -m virtualenv venv
```
In UNIX system: 

```
source venv/bin/activate
```
In Windows: 

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

To install all of the required packages to this environment, simply run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and all of the required `pip` packages, will be installed, and the app will be able to run.


### launch dashboard
Once all requirements are installed. Launch the dashboard with the following command:

```
python3 app.py
```

You will get the address that you need to go to on your browser, usually like this:

http://127.0.0.1:8050/
